This directory contains the test suite for the basic library, libdf.a.
After running the makefile at either the higher level or this level,
you will find two executable programs, testhdf and fortest, in this 
directory. Testhdf tests the C functions, while fortest the Fortran 
interface. At the end of execution, each program reports how many 
errors occurred. Please contact us at hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu 
if the test fails on your machine.

Special notes for fortest:
"fortest" is just a C-code front to parse command line arguments.
It produces a file, fortest.arg which contains lines of instruction
to invoke the real fortran test which is called fortestF.  Each line
in fortest.arg contains a command and a parameter.

	Command		Parameter	Description
	-------		---------	-----------

	Test		Name		Test <Name>
	Skip		Name		Skip test <Name>
	Cleanup		String		How to cleanup *.hdf
	Verbosity	Integer		Verbosity = <Integer>

"fortest" then invokes "fortestF" with "fortest.arg" as input.

Cleanup Commands
----------------
If <String> is Yes/No, it directs to delete the *.hdf files or not.
If <String> is not Yes/No, it represents the system command to delete
    the *.hdf files.  (NOTE: specifying a system command does not imply
    Cleanup.)



Verbosity convention
--------------------

The higher the verbosity value, the more information printed.
So, output for a higher verbosity value also includes the output of 
all lower verbosity values.

    Value	Description
    0		None:	No informational message.
    1			"All tests passed"
    2			Header of overall test
    3		Default: header and results of individual test
    4		
    5		Low:	Major category of tests.
    6
    7		Medium:	Minor category of tests such as functions called.
    8
    9		High:	Highest level.  All information.
