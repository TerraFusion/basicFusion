	.r24	- HDF file containing one or more 24-bit raster image sets
	.r8	- HDF file containing one or more 8-bit raster image sets,
		      with color palettes possible also included
	.sd	- HDF file containing one or more scientific data sets
	.pal	- HDF file containing one or more color palettes
	.raw	- non-HDF file containing binary data (image, float data, etc.)
