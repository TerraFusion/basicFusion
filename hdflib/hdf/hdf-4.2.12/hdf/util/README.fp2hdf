This revision of fptohdf, which we are calling fp2hdf,  supports native
mode floating point (both single and double precision), and 3D floating 
point data sets.

For these additions we owe our thanks to Bob Weaver and colleagues
at INEL.

You should be able to compile fp2hdf, as well as the two programs
for generating test data, by executing "make".  Note: you will
need to change some of the definitions in the makefile to conform
to your system.

Except for Makefile, fp2hdf.c, and this README file, all of the
files in this directory are for testing fp2hdf and illustrating
its use.
