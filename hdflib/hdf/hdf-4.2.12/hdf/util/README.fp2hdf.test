There are two sets of input files for testing fp2hdf.  These files
are used by the script fp2hdf.test.

I. The first set consists of 2-D data sets that produce images that are 
cross-hatched with 10 vertical and 10 horizontal lines.  These files
use the following naming conventions:

   't' prefix means it's a text file
   'h' prefix means it's an hdf file
   'h' at the end means horizontal scale is not uniform
   'v' at the end means vertical scale is not uniform
   'n' at the end means no scales are stored in the file
   dimensions are given between  prefix and postfix

The names of the files: (which are stored in the testfiles/fp2hdf directory)
                    t100x100  
                    h100x100  
                    h100x100h 
                    h100x100hv
                    h60x75    
                    h60x75v   
                    h60x75n   

II. The second set are generated by the programs ftest.c and ftest.F. 
They are small files with 2-D and 3-D data sets that are easily 
examined by eye.  Those that begin with the letter 'c' are 
produced with the program ftest.c, and those that begin with 'f'
were produced with ftest.F.

                   ctxtr3, type 'TEXT', size 3x4x5

                   cb32r3, type 'FP32', size 3x4x5

                   cb64r3, type 'FP64', size 3x4x5
     
                   ftxtr2, type 'TEXT', size 3x4
                   ftxtr3, type 'TEXT', size 3x4x5
                   fb32r2, type 'FP32', size 3x4
                   fb32r3, type 'FP32', size 3x4x5
                   fb64r2, type 'FP64', size 3x4
                   fb64r3, type 'FP64', size 3x4x5

Contents of the arrays:

  row    values start at 11 and increment by 1 => 11, 12, 13
  column values start at 21 and increment by 2 => 21, 23, 25, 27
  plane  values start at 51 and increment by 5 => 51, 56, 61, 66, 71

  data element value = row value + column value [+ plane value, if rank=3]
     

Output files can be examined with hdfls to see if basic
contents are there.  Those with raster images can be displayed
using NCSA Image, DataScope, etc.  Those with floating point
data can be examined using hdfed or DataScope.
