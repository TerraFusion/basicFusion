This directory contains source code for ncgen, a netCDF utility that
converts a CDL description of a netCDF file into a netCDF file, or that
generates the C or FORTRAN source code required to create the netCDF
file.  Before compiling the sources in this directory, you must have
already made the netCDF library from the ../src directory.

For VMS, first make sure you have compiled [-.util]getopt.c, then type
"@make".  The make.com, make.opt, and *-vms files are for VMS only.

For Microsoft MSDOS and OS/2 platforms, use the msoft.mk Makefile.

To test ncgen, you should first make sure the appropriate FORTRAN
jackets are compiled and installed in the netCDF library.  Then "make
test" will test creating a netCDF file from a test CDL file (in
test0.cdl), creating the same netCDF file by generating C code and
running it, and finally creating the same netCDF file by generating
FORTRAN code and running it.  If your FORTRAN compiler understands BYTE
declarations, you can uncomment the byte declarations and data in
test0.cdl before testing ncgen.
