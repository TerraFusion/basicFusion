This directory contains scripts that demonstrate various errors that might be found in the generateInput.sh script.
Each script generates an inputFiles.txt file as expected, but then reads a buggy input file that will cause the
script to throw errors. Note that the error messages present in these tests are not exhaustive of all the messages
programmed into the script. This is simply a way to show how the script will react under various circumstances

To run a script, type:
  ./[script name] [path to 5 TERRA HDF file directories]
